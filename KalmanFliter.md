# Introduction to Kalman Filter

The **Kalman Filter** is an algorithm that estimates the state of a dynamic system by combining **noisy measurements** and a **mathematical model** of the system. It uses statistical techniques to provide an optimal estimate of the system's state, even when the data is noisy or incomplete.

## Key Concepts

1. **State**:
   - The system's internal variables to be estimated (e.g., position, velocity, temperature).

2. **Measurements**:
   - Observations collected from sensors that might contain noise.

3. **Prediction and Correction**:
   - The Kalman Filter works in two steps:
     - **Prediction**: Predict the next state based on the system's model.
     - **Correction (Update)**: Update the prediction using actual sensor measurements to improve accuracy.

4. **Noise**:
   - The Kalman Filter assumes that the noise in both the system and measurements is **Gaussian** (normally distributed).

5. **Optimal Estimate**:
   - Combines the prediction and measurement to minimize the estimation error, using weights based on the system's and measurement's noise levels.

## How Does the Kalman Filter Work?

### Predict Step

Predict the next state (`x'`) and the associated uncertainty (`P'`) using the system's model.

- Equations:
  ```
  x' = A \cdot x + B \cdot u
  P' = A \cdot P \cdot A^T + Q
  ```

  Where:
  - `x`: Current state.
  - `A`: State transition matrix (system dynamics).
  - `B`: Control matrix.
  - `u`: Control input (e.g., acceleration).
  - `P`: Current state covariance matrix (uncertainty).
  - `Q`: Process noise covariance.

### Update Step

Use the actual measurement to correct the prediction.

- Equations:
  - Compute the Kalman Gain (`K`):
    ```
    K = P' \cdot H^T \cdot (H \cdot P' \cdot H^T + R)^{-1}
    ```
  - Update the state estimate:
    ```
    x = x' + K \cdot (z - H \cdot x')
    ```
  - Update the covariance matrix:
    ```
    P = (I - K \cdot H) \cdot P'
    ```

  Where:
  - `H`: Measurement matrix (relates state to measurements).
  - `z`: Actual measurement.
  - `R`: Measurement noise covariance.
  - `I`: Identity matrix.

### Repeat

Repeat the predict and update steps for every time step or measurement.

## Key Features

- **Recursive**:
  - Works step-by-step and doesn’t require storing all past data.

- **Optimal**:
  - Minimizes the estimation error if the system and measurement noise are Gaussian.

- **Robust**:
  - Can handle noisy and incomplete data effectively.

## Applications of Kalman Filters

1. **Navigation**:
   - GPS + Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data fusion for estimating position and velocity.
   
2. **Robotics**:
   - Robot localization and mapping (SLAM).
   - Path tracking.

3. **Signal Processing**:
   - Noise reduction in sensor signals.

4. **Control Systems**:
   - Estimating the state of a system to improve control accuracy (e.g., in PID or Model Predictive Control).

5. **Economics and Finance**:
   - Time-series prediction and stock price estimation.

## Example: Kalman Filter in 1D

### Problem

Estimate the position of a car moving in a straight line based on noisy position measurements.

### Steps

1. **State**: 
   - Position (`x`) and velocity (`v`) of the car.
   - State vector: `x = [[position], [velocity]]`.

2. **Model**:
   - The car moves with constant velocity: `x_{k+1} = A \cdot x_k + w`.
   - State transition matrix:
     ```
     A = [[1, \Delta t],
          [0, 1]]
     ```
     Where `\Delta t` is the time step.

3. **Measurements**:
   - Sensor provides noisy position measurements: `z = H \cdot x + v`.
   - Measurement matrix:
     ```
     H = [[1, 0]]
     ```

4. **Noise**:
   - Process noise covariance (`Q`) and measurement noise covariance (`R`) are predefined.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Predict:
     ```
     x' = A \cdot x
     P' = A \cdot P \cdot A^T + Q
     ```
   - Update:
     ```
     K = P' \cdot H^T \cdot (H \cdot P' \cdot H^T + R)^{-1}
     x = x' + K \cdot (z - H \cdot x')
     P = (I - K \cdot H) \cdot P'
     ```

## Code Example (Python)

Here’s a simple implementation of a 1D Kalman Filter:

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize variables
x = np.array([[0], [0]])  # Initial state [position, velocity]
P = np.eye(2)             # Initial state covariance
A = np.array([[1, 1],     # State transition matrix
              [0, 1]])
H = np.array([[1, 0]])    # Measurement matrix
Q = np.array([[0.01, 0],  # Process noise covariance
              [0, 0.01]])
R = np.array([[0.1]])     # Measurement noise covariance

# Measurements (noisy position data)
measurements = [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]

for z in measurements:
    # Prediction
    x = A @ x
    P = A @ P @ A.T + Q

    # Measurement update
    K = P @ H.T @ np.linalg.inv(H @ P @ H.T + R)
    z = np.array([[z]])  # Measurement
    x = x + K @ (z - H @ x)
    P = (np.eye(2) - K @ H) @ P

    print(f"Estimated State: {x.flatten()}")
```

## Challenges with Kalman Filters

1. **Model Accuracy**:
   - If the system or noise models are incorrect, the filter may perform poorly.

2. **Tuning**:
   - Selecting appropriate values for `Q` and `R` is critical and often requires trial and error.

3. **Computational Load**:
   - In high-dimensional systems, matrix computations can become expensive.
